"Arquivos_Armazenados" Will Keep the Excel Files Stored, so Then They can Be Used t/
Consult, when the streamlit application is runnning..

Pretty Much Like a DataBase.
When you click "Limpar e Fechar", the application will clean the stored files and shut down the
server, closing the ports which are running the files ('5001', '8501' and '8502').
